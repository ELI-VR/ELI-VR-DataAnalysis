PREPROCESS QUESTIONNAIRE AND MS-RATING DATA
1. download the questionnaire data from www.soscisurvey.de (Excel, "Numerische Codes", "Fehlende Werte entfernen")
2. rename the the excel file to "data_questionnaires.xlsx" and move it to the "data" folder
3. delete all the participants that should be excluded from the main analysis (e.g. pilots, or people that started the questionnaire twice)
4. move all overview files to the "data" folder (i.e. "001_BlobHybrid_01234.json", "001_BlobFirstperson_03124.json", etc.)
5. run 'main_preprocessing.py' 
--> this will create a new file called "data_questionnaires_preprocessed.xlsx" that includes the 
preprocessed questionnaire data and the in-game rating data for all participants

!! make sure that only participant files are in the data folder + in the excel that exist in both the questionnaire data
and the live game data !!
